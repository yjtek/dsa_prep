    "- The idea behind a Merkle Tree is quite simple, and best illustrated with a problem:\n",
    "    - Let's suppose I have a huge array of values (e.g. in a database)\n",
    "    - Because of the distributed nature of my database, to maintain consistency, I need to sync data across different nodes periodically\n",
    "    - At some point, I notice that one of my nodes has gone down! So some new data transactions have occurred in my DB, and the node that was dead did not receive these new data\n",
    "    - Once the node restarts, its data is inconsistent with the others. \n",
    "    - How would I know what is different?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"brute force\" solution to something like this would be to completely rewrite the entire database from one of the updated replicas\n",
    "    - This is $O(N)$ in the amount of data you have, which is not ideal\n",
    "    - If the number of dropped transactions is small, you are doing a lot of redundant replication, because 99.99% of data could be the same! This is wasteful\n",
    "    - Can we do better? Yes we can!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enter Merkel Trees\n",
    "    - A Merkel Tree is simply a binary tree\n",
    "    - Each node in the tree:\n",
    "        - Contains a value (like a regular binary tree)\n",
    "        - Contains an hash value of the hashes of its left and right children\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does this help us solve the problem?\n",
    "    - Imagine each database replica has a Merkel tree constructed and maintained, which takes $O(N)$ space\n",
    "        - Let's call the 2 replicas `A` and `B`\n",
    "    - Imagine replica `A` goes down and it misses some data transactions\n",
    "        - As a result, the hash value at the root node of `A` will be different from the hash value at the root node of `B`\n",
    "            - Why? Because somewhere down the tree, the value at a leaf node is different, and as a result this difference will bubble upwards \n",
    "        - So the root is different. We now compare 1 level down;\n",
    "            - In this case, the left child contains nodes in the first half of the array, and the right contains nodes in the second\n",
    "        - If the difference is only in the first half of the array, the right hashes will still match!\n",
    "            - Therefore, we know that we only need to copy the leaves of the second half of the array!"
