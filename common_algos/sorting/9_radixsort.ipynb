    "- Idea\n",
    "    - The idea of Radix sort is quite simple; for all integers in the array, we sort them digit by digit\n",
    "        - If we sort from the right, then it is called \"Least significant digit\" (LSD) sort\n",
    "        - If we sort from the left, then it is called \"Most significant digit\" (MSD) sort\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since sorting happens digit-wise, we need to ensure that the digit sorting doesn't break the existing order of the array. That is, we need a stable sort\n",
    "    - Why is this important?\n",
    "    - Imagine we have an array [1,12,123,2,23,234]\n",
    "    - Let's start the sort\n",
    "        - Sort by rightmost value:\n",
    "            - [1,12,2,123,23,234]\n",
    "            - Notice that this is a stable sort; 12 comes before 2, even though the last value is 2 in both cases, because 12 appears first in the array\n",
    "        - Sort by next value:\n",
    "            - [1,2,12,123,23,234]\n",
    "            - Now it is clear why we must maintain the order of the existing array in the event of ties; because array is already sorted according to the previous digit\n",
    "            - That is, we dont want a situation where 2 gets placed before 1 even thought 1 came first; because 1 has a smaller first digit than 2!\n",
    "        - Sort by next value:\n",
    "            - [1,2,12,23,123,234]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that all values are assumed to be integers, and values are bounded to the numeric base they use\n",
    "    - for example, digit-wise comparison in a base-10 number can only range from 0-9\n",
    "    - Therefore, in such a case, we can use counting sort for its superior run time $O(N+K)$, where K=10 in a base 10 number system and N is the size of the input array"
