    "- We've looked at AVL trees to keep trees balanced\n",
    "- There are many other BST structures, all designed to optimise for different things\n",
    "- We will look at Splay Trees, which are optimised to make average lookup time short\n",
    "    - To do this, after every look up, splay trees push the nodes upwards from the leaf to the root, so you can access it faster without traversing the full height of the tree!\n",
    "    - i.e. you trade off balance, for less height traversal\n",
    "    - vs AVL trees, which takes $O(\\log(N))$ for look ups in on average\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive way to push stuff to the top: just rotate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better way: Rearrange depending on node and its parent\n",
    "    - So just do a case analysis depending on the current arrangement; Zig Zig, Zig Zag, or Zig\n",
    "    - See notes for details\n",
    "    - Just keep calling `Splay()` until $N$ reaches the root"
