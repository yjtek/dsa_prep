    "- This is probably the most important problem in this book. As the last question on an interview, your future boss gives you a few pieces of paper with a single number written on each of them and asks you to compose a largest number from these numbers. The resulting number is going to be your salary, so you are very motivated to solve this problem\n",

As we know already, this algorithm does not always maximize your salary: for example, for an input consisting of two integers 23 and 3 it returns 233, while the largest number is 323.\n",
