    "- Quick sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, and is $O(n \\log(n))$ run time on average\n",
    "- The idea of quick sort is quite simple, but takes some getting used to. We'll talk through this using an example\n",
    "    - Imagine we have an input array [6,4,2,3,9,8,9,4,7,6,1]\n",
    "    - We first need to choose a value to sort against, known as the **pivot**. \n",
    "        - We will iterate through this list, and compare all the other values to this pivot\n",
    "        - At the end of this process, we want to end up with 2 regions. One of the regions will have all values $v \\le \\text{pivot}$, and the other will have values $v \\gt \\text{pivot}$\n",
    "        - Finally, we place our pivot in the middle of these 2 regions, and the pivot is now in the correct position\n",
    "        - Call quicksort on the left and right regions\n",
    "- Intuition and issues\n",
    "    - Quicksort is faster because we are iteratively halving our sort space. Though the first sort requires a full scan of $n$ elements, we are recursively halving the comparisons, thus creating the $\\log(n)$\n",
    "    - However, quicksort performance is very dependent on your pivot choice. It is only $O(n \\log(n))$ on average. In the worst case, it is $O(N^2)$, which is basically selection sort\n",
    "    - To see how it is $O(N^2)$ in the worst case, we can simply imagine a list that is already sorted, and we pick the pivot from the end of the list\n",
    "    - So instead of halving the list at each iteration, we are simply removing the last element"

    "    - But the recursive calls to left and right also takes some space on the call stack! So even though the quicksort algorithm just modifies the original input array, it is recursively creating storing values on the call stack\n",
    "    - In the worst case, when the array is already sorted (i.e. in the $O(N^2)$ time complexity case), the recursion has to be called $N$ times, leading to $N$ copies of the array being made in the stack\n",
