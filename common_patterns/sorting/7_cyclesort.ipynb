    "- This is an interesting algorithm, because it is useful when overwriting the value is expensive. \n",
    "    - So the idea is, not only do you want to do the sort quickly, but you would also like to minimise the number of times you overwrite values in the array while sorting\n",
    "    - Take something like bubble sort for example. If we compare adjacent values and swap values that are not ordered, we end repeating the expensive write operation multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the insight behind this approach?\n",
    "    - First, note that any permutation of an array can be expressed as a product of cycles\n",
    "        - A \"cycle\" here means a series of swaps such that the starting node and ending node are the same. (e.g. A --> B, B --> C, C --> A)\n",
    "        - That is, no matter how the values are arranged at the start, any rearrangement into a sorted order can be expressed as a series of cycles, or at least 1 cycle\n",
    "            - Just imagine an array shifted rightwards by 1. (A --> B, B --> C, C --> ... X --> A)\n",
    "            - This is just 1 massive cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "- So the logic is; if we move values according to its cycles, it must result in the minimum number of moves\n",
    "    - because each value moves to its \"correct\" position immediately, we do not make any extra moves "

    "\n",
