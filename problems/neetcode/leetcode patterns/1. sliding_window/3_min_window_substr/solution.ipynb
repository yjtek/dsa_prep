    "    - You used a heap to keep track of where to move your left pointer to; this trades off space for time\n",
    "        - i.e. you don't need to increment l 1 by 1 until you reach a valid next value, but you need a heap object\n",
    "    - A heap also requires O(\\log N) time to pop and push, so may negatively affect your time complexity due to N log N operation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Instead of comparing dictionary keys and values, which is horrendously slow, you can use a simply counter to flag the validity of the substring\n",
    "        - So every time you see something that fits, you increment the counter, and everytime you see something that doesn't, you decrement it\n",
    "        - So you use the hashmap to maintain counts, and if the count falls below the `t` counter, decrement the `have` flag. \n",
    "        - And if you meet a new character that is in `t`, increment the `have` flag IF AND ONLY IF adding the 1 character to the hashmap causes equality in counts\n",
    "        - In this way, you will never end up running the while loop erroneously\n",
