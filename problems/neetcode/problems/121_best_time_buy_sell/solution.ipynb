    "    - You only need to loop over the array once\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Starting from point 0, consider this as your \"buy\" leg\n",
    "    - Run through all other values in the array as your sell leg\n",
    "        - If your sell leg candidates have value that exceeds point 0, maintain max_profit as `max_profit = max(prices[sell] - prices[buy], max_profit)`\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ELSE you will have found a value that is less than your buy leg. In which case, you no longer need to consider the profits from your previous buy leg \n",
    "            - Why? Because any profits have been recorded, and if there are any future profits, it must be more profitable to buy here instead of buying at the old point\n",
    "\n",
    "            - For example, imagine [5,7,1,8,2]\n",
    "                - You start with 5, and you take 7 as a sell candidate\n",
    "                - You find profit = 2\n",
    "                - Then you increment sell index to 1\n",
    "                - 1 becomes your new \"buy\" leg since 1 < 5\n",
    "                - Then your sell leg goes to 8\n",
    "                - Update profit to 8 - 1 = 7\n",
    "                - Obviously, 8 - 5 is also profitable, but it is no longer relevant because there is a better \"buy\" leg at 1\n"
