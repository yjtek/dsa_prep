    "- Brute force\n",
    "    - Keep iterating through both lists in a loop (i.e. loop within LL1 and LL2)\n",
    "    - Keep track of each pair of nodes in a set (one from LL1, one from LL2)\n",
    "    - For each pair, check if LL1 node == LL2 node\n",
    "    - Loop ends when you encounter a duplicate set of nodes\n",
    "    - This runs in $O(N \\cdot M)$ (lowest common multiple is N * M in the worst case) with no extra memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approach 1\n",
    "    - Iterate through LL1 and LL2, and add the nodes seen into a hash set\n",
    "    - If we reach the end of both LL without seeing the same node, then no intersection\n",
    "    - Else it intersects at the duplicated node\n",
    "    - Runs in $O(\\max(N,M))$ time and $O(N+M)$ space\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approach 2\n",
    "    - Iterate through LL1 and LL2 once, and count the lengths of both\n",
    "    - Take difference in lengths L2 - L1 = m\n",
    "    - Iterate $m$ steps into the longer list\n",
    "        - From and including the intersection, the list must be the same (i.e. aligned)\n",
    "        - So since the intersection (if any) must align, we just align the start of both lists such that the intersection will be the $i$-th node \n",
    "    - Going node by node, iterate until we find the intersection, or the list ends\n",
    "    - This takes 2 passes of both lists \n",
    "        - Once to count the lengths in $O(N+M)$\n",
    "        - Once to iterate through both in $O(N)$ (because you still need to skip the first few steps of the longer list)\n",
    "        - This gives us $O(N+M)$ overall performance\n",
    "    - No extra space is used, so $O(1)$ space\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approach 3: TRICK\n",
    "    - Loop LL1 and LL2 together\n",
    "    - Start iteration from LL1 and LL2 separately, and iterate both for len(LL1) + len(LL2) steps\n",
    "    - When you reach the end of LL1, go to the start of LL2, and vice versa\n",
    "    - This guarantees that after len(LL1) + len(LL2) steps, you are at the same node, assuming there is an intersection\n",
    "    - But if you are at the same node, then the previous node must also be the same\n",
    "    - And so on and so forth\n",
    "    - So at some point, you must have been at the intersection node at the same time!\n",
    "    - Therefore, this will run in $O(N+M)$ time with $O(1)$ space"
