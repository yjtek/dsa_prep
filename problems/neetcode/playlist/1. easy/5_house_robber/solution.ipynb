    "- How do we programmatically decide which choice is better? \n",
    "    - Notice, at each point in the array, you can either choose to rob the current house (which means you can also rob the 2nd last house in the array), or you can choose to skip the current house and rob the previous house\n",

    "    - At house 3, either we rob this current house (which lets us also rob house 1), or we don't rob this house and rob the previous house \n",
    "        - So the payoff at house 3 is `max(1+3, 2)`\n",
    "    \n",
