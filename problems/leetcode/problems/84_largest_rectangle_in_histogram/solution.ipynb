    "- Idea\n",
    "    - Go through `enumerate(heights)` one by one\n",
    "    - Init an empty stack\n",
    "    - If the current value of heights array exceeds the top of the stack, append `(index, height)` to stack\n",
    "    - while the current value of height array is LOWER than the top of the stack\n",
    "        - Pop from stack (stack_top_index, stack_top_value)\n",
    "        - Since `stack_top_value` is guaranteed to be greater than current value\n",
    "            - it must be true that we can extend the current value backwards to `stack_top_index`\n",
    "            - it must also be true that `stack_top_value` can no longer be extended rightwards (because it has encountered a lower bar)\n",
    "            - Therefore, the maximum area that has height of `stack_top_value` must be the `current_index - stack_top_index`\n",
    "            - Update result using `max(max_result, (current_index - stack_top_index) * stack_top_value)`\n",
    "            - Add the current (smaller) value as a potential height candidate to the stack `(stack_top_index, height)`\n",
    "            - Why do we use `stack_top_index` as the index? Because we know that the current height is definitely extendable backwards up till that index!!\n",
    "    - Once we are done with these, we know that we have dealt with all cases where the max area is in the middle of the chart\n",
    "    - So iterate through the stack to take the height multiplied by the maximum width from the position of `h` (len(heights)-index)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The trick you missed here is that your stack can contain more than just values, you can add anything to a stack to help your backtracking!!"
