    "- This is kind of a \"trick-based\" question. That is, you're probably only going to be able to solve it efficiently if you know the trick\n",
    "\n",
    "- The trick here is to use 2 pointers in a unique manner:\n",
    "    - Both pointers start at the head of the linked list\n",
    "    - Pointer one increments by 1, pointer two increments by 2\n",
    "    - So when pointer two is at the end of the linked list, pointer 1 is at the midpoint!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having done this, to check if the linked list is a palindrome, going forward from pointer 1 at the midpoint to the end must be the same as going backward from pointer 1 to the head\n",
    "\n",
    "- But hang on, this is a **singly** linked list. So how can we move backwards?\n",
    "    - In this case, we need to reverse the left half of the linked list up to the midpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complexity analysis\n",
    "    - Overall time complexity is $O(N)$\n",
    "        - To traverse the entire list, we take $O(N)$ time\n",
    "        - To reverse a linked list, also takes $O(N)$ time\n",
    "        - To compare the 2 sub linked lists, will take $O(N)$ time\n",
    "    - Overall space complexity is $O(1)$\n",
    "        - No additional space is used because we are just traversing and modifying the existing list\n",
