    "- Idea:\n",
    "    - This pattern is backtracking with a stack to hold intermediate values\n",
    "    - Since you have `n` pairs of parenthesis, you can only have at most `n` opening and `n` closing brackets\n",
    "    - At each point, you cannot have more closing than opening brackets\n",
    "    - So you maintain a backtracking function, counting the number of open and close brackets you've used\n",
    "    - Add an additional open/close depending on the counts\n",
    "    - Terminate when you use all `n` pairs, and append to result\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technically you don't really need an additional stack object. You can always pass intermediate values into the backtracking function\n",
    "    - We'll implement both for familiarity \n",
