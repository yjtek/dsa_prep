## 263. Ugly Number

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

### Examples 

Example 1:
- Input: n = 6
- Output: true
- Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3

Example 2:
- Input: n = 1
- Output: true
- Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Example 3:
- Input: n = 14
- Output: false
- Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

### Constraints:
- $-2^{31} <= n <= 2^{31} - 1$

### Starter Code
```
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        ...
```
