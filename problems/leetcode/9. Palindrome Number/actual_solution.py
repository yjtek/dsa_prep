'''
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:

Input: x = -101
Output: false
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

# No amazing solution. See testing notebook for details, but this is mainly to teach you the trick of reversing an integer without treating it like a string (use modulo to derive the value.)

def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
	if x < 0 or (x > 0 and x%10 == 0):   # if x is negative, return False. if x is positive and last digit is 0, that also cannot form a palindrome, return False.
		return False
	
	result = 0
	while x > result:
		result = result * 10 + x % 10
		x = x // 10
		
	return True if (x == result or x == result // 10) else False
